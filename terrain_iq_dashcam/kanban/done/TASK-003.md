# Implement folder-based Kanban board system

## Description

Create Python CLI tool with click and rich libraries, folder structure for task management, comprehensive documentation, and activation scripts

## Use Case

Provide git-friendly task management system optimized for AI agent and human collaboration. Avoid merge conflicts by using individual files per task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create folder structure with 5 columns (backlog, ready, in_progress, review, done)
- [x] Implement Python CLI with click and rich libraries
- [x] Implement 9 commands (show, add, move, assign, details, stats, update, delete, list-files)
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md documentation
- [x] Create activation script (kb) for easy access
- [x] Support metadata tracking in board-metadata.json

## Test Data

### Good Samples
- Tasks properly organized by column
- Color-coded terminal output
- Task movement between columns

### Bad Samples
- N/A

## Notes

- [2025-10-12 06:17] Completed: Implemented kanban.py CLI tool with 9 commands, created folder structure, documentation, and kb activation script
- Uses Python venv for dependency isolation
- Rich library provides beautiful terminal formatting
- System designed for no-conflict concurrent editing
