# Create Flutter Web Test Suite with Playwright

## Description

Build web version of Flutter app and create Playwright browser automation tests. Setup includes: Flutter web build configuration, browser test environment, test scripts for UI interactions, and mock implementations for sensors/camera in web environment. Create visual regression tests and performance benchmarks.

## Use Case

Enable browser-based testing of Flutter app without needing physical devices. Allow automated UI testing in CI/CD pipelines. Support visual regression testing and cross-browser compatibility validation. Useful for rapid prototyping and UI testing during development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Flutter web build successfully configured
- [ ] App runs in Chrome/Safari/Firefox browsers
- [ ] Playwright test framework installed
- [ ] Test can navigate between app screens
- [ ] UI element selectors working reliably
- [ ] Mock sensor data implementation
- [ ] Mock camera implementation (placeholder)
- [ ] Mock GPS implementation
- [ ] Visual regression tests configured
- [ ] Screenshot comparison working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks implemented
- [ ] Tests pass on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test execution time under 3 minutes
- [ ] CI/CD integration configured

## Subtasks

- [ ] Configure Flutter for web platform
- [ ] Build web version of app
- [ ] Setup local web server for testing
- [ ] Install Playwright (@playwright/test)
- [ ] Create test/e2e/web/ directory
- [ ] Configure Playwright browsers
- [ ] Implement Flutter web test utilities
- [ ] Create navigation test (splash to driving)
- [ ] Create UI interaction test (buttons, toggles)
- [ ] Implement sensor data mocking in browser
- [ ] Create mock camera placeholder
- [ ] Create mock GPS coordinate injection
- [ ] Implement visual regression baseline
- [ ] Create screenshot comparison tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Create cross-browser test matrix
- [ ] Add CI/CD workflow
- [ ] Document web testing setup

## Test Data

### Good Samples

**Mock Sensor Data:**
- Accelerometer: x=1.5, y=2.0, z=9.8
- Gyroscope: x=0.1, y=0.2, z=0.0
- GPS: lat=37.7749, lng=-122.4194

**Performance Metrics:**
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- First contentful paint < 1 second
- Time to interactive < 2 seconds

### Bad Samples

**Error States:**
- Sensor API not supported in browser
- Camera permission denied
- Network timeout
- JavaScript errors in console

## Notes

- Flutter web has limited sensor API support
- Camera requires WebRTC fallback
- GPS requires browser geolocation API
- Visual regression may have cross-platform differences
- Use headless mode for CI/CD
- Store baseline screenshots in version control
- Consider Percy or similar for visual testing
- Add accessibility testing (axe-core)
- Test responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop viewports)
