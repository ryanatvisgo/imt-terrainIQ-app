# Design Settings screen layout

## Description

Create Settings screen design with configuration options: proximity threshold, update frequency, hazard type filters, recording quality, MQTT settings, and About/Version info

## Use Case

Users need a comprehensive settings screen to configure app behavior, adjust thresholds, filter hazard types, configure MQTT connection, adjust recording quality, and view app information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design settings screen layout (wireframe or mockup)
- [ ] Include proximity threshold configuration (slider/input)
- [ ] Include update frequency setting
- [ ] Include hazard type filters (checkboxes for each type)
- [ ] Include recording quality options
- [ ] Include MQTT server configuration section
- [ ] Include About/Version information display
- [ ] Ensure design works in both portrait and landscape
- [ ] Add to simulator as viewable screen option

## Test Data

### Good Samples
- Default settings configuration
- Custom proximity threshold (e.g., 500m)
- Filtered hazard types (e.g., only potholes and debris)
- Custom MQTT server configuration

### Bad Samples
- Invalid proximity threshold (negative numbers)
- Invalid MQTT server address format

## Implementation Notes

### Settings Categories

#### Proximity & Alerts
- Proximity threshold (100m - 1000m slider)
- Update frequency (1s - 10s)
- Alert sound volume

#### Hazard Filters
- [ ] Potholes
- [ ] Speed Bumps
- [ ] Debris
- [ ] Rough Road
- [ ] Sharp Turns
- [ ] Flooding

#### Recording
- Video quality (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- Auto-record on hazard detection
- Storage location
- Max storage size

#### MQTT Configuration
- Server address
- Port
- Username/Password
- Connection status indicator

#### About
- App version
- Build number
- Last update date
- Terms & Privacy links

### Design Considerations
- Use iOS native UI components style
- Group related settings together
- Provide clear labels and descriptions
- Show current values prominently
- Add "Reset to Defaults" option

## Dependencies
- TASK-006 (for displaying in simulator)
