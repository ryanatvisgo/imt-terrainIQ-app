# Auto-Record Motion Detection Implementation - 2025-10-10

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive auto-record system with motion detection, sensor data logging, and server synchronization for TerrainIQ Dashcam.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. âœ… Motion Detection Service (`MotionService`)

**File:** `lib/services/motion_service.dart`

**Capabilities:**
- Device orientation detection (forward, backward, flat, unknown)
- Motion detection using accelerometer (2.0 m/sÂ² threshold)
- Idle timeout tracking (30 seconds)
- Road roughness calculation from accelerometer variance
- Real-time sensor data streaming

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()` - Start sensor listeners
- `shouldStartRecording` - Check if motion + valid orientation
- `shouldStopRecording` - Check if idle > 30s or invalid orientation
- `calculateRoughness()` - Returns 0.0-1.0 roughness metric
- `getRoughnessLevel()` - Returns smooth/moderate/rough/very_rough

**Orientation Logic:**
- **Forward**: Phone's top edge facing down (Y > 7.0)
- **Backward**: Phone's bottom edge facing down (Y < -7.0)
- **Flat**: Phone lying flat (|Z| > 7.0)
- **Unknown**: Other orientations (not valid for recording)

### 2. âœ… CSV Data Logging Service (`DataLoggerService`)

**File:** `lib/services/data_logger_service.dart`

**Features:**
- Creates CSV file alongside each video recording
- Logs data every 100ms during recording
- Headers: timestamp, accel_x/y/z, gyro_x/y/z, roughness, roughness_level, orientation, is_moving
- Automatic file save on recording stop

**CSV Format:**
```csv
timestamp,accel_x,accel_y,accel_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z,roughness,roughness_level,orientation,is_moving
2025-10-10T12:00:00.000Z,0.1234,0.5678,9.8000,0.0100,0.0200,0.0050,0.2500,smooth,forward,true
```

### 3. âœ… Server Communication Service (`ServerService`)

**File:** `lib/services/server_service.dart`

**Features:**
- **Heartbeat System:**
  - 60s interval while recording
  - 300s interval while idle
  - Sends status, timestamp, upload queue size

- **Video Upload System:**
  - WiFi-only mode by default (configurable)
  - Automatic upload queue management
  - Multipart file upload with metadata
  - Server returns video URL
  - Deletes local file after successful upload
  - Creates `.url` placeholder with server link

- **Connectivity Detection:**
  - Monitors WiFi/cellular connection changes
  - Auto-processes queue when WiFi available

### 4. âœ… Auto-Record Toggle UI

**File:** `lib/screens/simple_dashcam_screen.dart`

**UI Components:**
- Toggle switch: "Auto-Record on Motion"
- Real-time status indicators:
  - ðŸš— Motion status (Moving/Stopped)
  - ðŸ“± Orientation (forward/backward/flat/unknown)
  - ðŸŒŠ Road roughness (smooth/moderate/rough/very_rough)
- Border color changes: Green (enabled) / Grey (disabled)

**Auto-Record Logic:**
- Checks conditions every 1 second
- Starts recording when: motion detected + valid orientation
- Stops recording when: idle > 30s OR invalid orientation
- Does NOT auto-switch to recordings tab (stays on camera for next trigger)

### 5. âœ… Integrated Recording Workflow

**When Recording Starts:**
1. CameraService starts video recording
2. DataLoggerService creates CSV file
3. ServerService notified (starts 60s heartbeat)
4. Timer starts logging sensor data every 100ms

**When Recording Stops:**
1. CameraService stops video recording
2. DataLoggerService saves CSV file
3. ServerService notified (switches to 300s heartbeat)
4. Video added to StorageService
5. Video queued for upload
6. SnackBar: "Recording saved and queued for upload!"

### 6. âœ… Mock Server for Testing

**Directory:** `mock_server/`

**Files:**
- `server.js` - Express server implementation
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /heartbeat` - Receives heartbeat signals
- `POST /upload` - Accepts video uploads (multipart/form-data)
- `GET /status` - View server stats and uploaded files
- `GET /videos/:filename` - Serve uploaded videos

**Running the Mock Server:**
```bash
cd mock_server
npm install
npm start
# Server starts on http://localhost:3000
```

### 7. âœ… iOS Configuration Updates

**File:** `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

**Added:**
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
  <true/>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

Allows HTTP connections to localhost for mock server testing.

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock server uses localhost** - Production needs real server URL
2. **Orientation detection is simplified** - Could use more sophisticated algorithms
3. **No retry mechanism** - Upload failures don't retry automatically
4. **No compression** - Videos uploaded at full size
5. **CSV files not uploaded** - Only videos are uploaded, CSV stays local

### Future Enhancements
1. **Smart orientation calibration** - Let user calibrate "forward" position
2. **Configurable thresholds** - UI to adjust motion/idle timeouts
3. **Upload retry logic** - Exponential backoff on failures
4. **Video compression** - Compress before upload to save bandwidth
5. **CSV upload** - Upload CSV alongside video or embed in metadata
6. **Battery optimization** - Reduce sensor polling when not in use
7. **Storage warnings** - Alert user when disk space low
8. **Upload progress** - Show upload progress in UI
9. **Offline mode** - Better handling of no connectivity
10. **Analytics** - Track recording patterns and statistics

## Debugging Tips

### Motion Not Detecting
- Check sensor permissions in iOS Settings
- Verify MotionService logs in console: `ðŸ”µ MotionService: Initializing...`
- Watch orientation status in UI - should update in real-time
- Try more vigorous movement (> 2.0 m/sÂ² threshold)

### Recording Not Auto-Starting
- Ensure auto-record toggle is ON (green border)
- Check orientation is "forward" or "backward" (not "flat" or "unknown")
- Verify motion status shows "Moving" (green)
- Look for logs: `ðŸš— Auto-record: Starting recording (motion detected)`

### Recording Not Auto-Stopping
- Wait full 30 seconds of stillness
- Check orientation hasn't changed to invalid
- Look for logs: `ðŸ›‘ Auto-record: Stopping recording (idle or invalid orientation)`

### CSV Files Not Created
- Check DataLoggerService logs: `ðŸ”µ DataLoggerService: Starting logging...`
- Verify app has file write permissions
- Check documents directory for `.csv` files

### Server Not Receiving Heartbeats
- Ensure mock server is running on port 3000
- Check iOS device and Mac are on same network
- Verify Info.plist has NSAllowsLocalNetworking
- Look for server console: `ðŸ’“ Heartbeat #N received:`

### Videos Not Uploading
- Check WiFi connection (WiFi-only mode by default)
- Verify mock server is running
- Check server console for upload logs
- Look for app logs: `ðŸ“¤ ServerService: Uploading video...`

## Code Examples

### Using MotionService
```dart
final motionService = Provider.of<MotionService>(context);

// Check if should record
if (motionService.shouldStartRecording) {
  // Start recording
}

// Get sensor data
print('Orientation: ${motionService.orientation}');
print('Moving: ${motionService.isMoving}');
print('Roughness: ${motionService.getRoughnessLevel()}');
```

### Using DataLoggerService
```dart
final dataLogger = Provider.of<DataLoggerService>(context, listen: false);

// Start logging
await dataLogger.startLogging('video_123.mp4');

// Log data point
dataLogger.logDataPoint(
  accelX: 0.1,
  accelY: 9.8,
  accelZ: 0.0,
  // ... other params
);

// Stop and save
await dataLogger.stopLogging();
```

### Using ServerService
```dart
final serverService = Provider.of<ServerService>(context, listen: false);

// Initialize
await serverService.initialize();

// Set recording status
serverService.setRecordingStatus(true);

// Queue video for upload
serverService.queueVideoUpload('/path/to/video.mp4');

// Enable cellular uploads
serverService.setWifiOnlyMode(false);
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Resource Usage
- **Sensor polling**: ~10-20 Hz (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- **Data logging**: 10 Hz (100ms intervals)
- **CSV file size**: ~1KB per second of recording
- **Auto-record check**: 1 Hz (every 1 second)
- **Heartbeat**: 0.017 Hz recording / 0.003 Hz idle

### Battery Impact
- **Sensors**: Moderate impact (accelerometer/gyroscope always on)
- **CSV logging**: Low impact (simple file writes)
- **Network**: Low impact (periodic heartbeats)
- **Uploads**: High impact during WiFi upload (temporary)
