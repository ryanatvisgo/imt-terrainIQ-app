## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Camera Initialization Failing
**Problem:** "Camera not available" error on iPhone
**Investigation:**
- Missing iOS permissions in Info.plist
- Permission request timing issues
- Camera initialization before permissions granted

**Solution (In Progress):**
- Added iOS Info.plist permission descriptions
- Implemented debugging UI to show permission status
- Added "Request Permissions" and "Open Settings" buttons
- Using `Consumer2<CameraService, PermissionService>` to monitor both states

### Challenge 2: Property Name Mismatch
**Problem:** Build error - `fileSize` property doesn't exist
**Root Cause:** VideoRecording model uses `fileSizeBytes`, not `fileSize`
**Solution:** Changed `recording.fileSize` to `recording.fileSizeBytes` in `simple_dashcam_screen.dart:550`

### Challenge 3: Flutter Debugger Disconnect Issues
**Problem:** `flutter run` loses connection frequently
**Workarounds:**
- Use `flutter attach` for reconnection
- App continues running even when debugger disconnects
- Manual launch from iPhone works independently of debugger

---

## Development Workflow Learned

### Option 1: Hot Reload (Recommended for UI changes)
```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
# Then press 'r' for hot reload or 'R' for hot restart
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. Build and deploy with `flutter run`
2. Test manually on device
3. Report issues
4. Make changes and rebuild

### Option 3: Xcode (Best for native debugging)
```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
# Run from Xcode for full iOS logs
```

### When to Use Full Rebuild
- Native changes (Info.plist, AndroidManifest.xml)
- New dependencies added to pubspec.yaml
- Build errors that hot reload can't fix

---

## Technical Decisions

### Why PIP + Fullscreen Pattern?
- **UX:** User can see recording is active without obscuring full view
- **Flexibility:** Swipe gesture allows quick expansion
- **Context:** Main screen stays accessible during recording
- **Mobile-friendly:** Touch-optimized interaction

### Why Provider for State Management?
- **Simple:** Easy to understand and maintain
- **Reactive:** Widgets automatically rebuild on state changes
- **Scalable:** Works well for this app's complexity
- **Standard:** Common pattern in Flutter community

### Why Separate Services?
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each service has single responsibility
- **Testability:** Can test services independently
- **Reusability:** Services can be used by multiple screens
- **Maintainability:** Changes isolated to specific service

---

## Code Architecture

### Service Layer
```
CameraService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ initializeCamera() - Setup camera controller
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startRecording() - Begin video capture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stopRecording() - End capture, return file path
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ toggleRecording() - Convenience method

StorageService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ initialize() - Setup directories, load recordings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ addRecording() - Register new recording
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deleteRecording() - Remove recording
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ getTotalStorageUsed() - Calculate storage

PermissionService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checkPermissions() - Check current permission status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requestAllPermissions() - Request all at once
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual permission methods for each type
```

### UI Flow
```
App Launch
    ‚Üì
Permission Check/Request
    ‚Üì
Camera Initialization
    ‚Üì
Ready Screen (Camera Icon)

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `.claude/sessions/2025-10-10-dashcam-development.md` (this file)

### Modified
1. `lib/main.dart` - Added Provider setup
2. `lib/screens/simple_dashcam_screen.dart` - Complete rewrite with PIP, fullscreen, playback
3. `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added permission descriptions

- `lib/services/permission_service.dart` - Working as designed
- `lib/models/video_recording.dart` - Good structure

---

## Debugging Techniques Used

### 1. Error Logging
Added `debugPrint()` statements in services to track initialization flow

### 2. Permission Status Display
Created debugging UI that shows:
- Camera permission status (Granted/Denied)
- Microphone permission status (Granted/Denied)
- Buttons to request permissions or open settings

### 3. Build Error Analysis
- Read Xcode build output carefully
- Identified missing properties (`fileSize` vs `fileSizeBytes`)
- Fixed by checking actual model definition

### 4. Hot Reload vs Full Rebuild
- Hot reload for UI changes
- Full rebuild (`flutter clean`) for native changes

---

## Best Practices Followed

### ‚úÖ Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages in SnackBars
- Graceful fallbacks when services fail

### ‚úÖ Resource Management
- Proper disposal of camera controllers
- Video player controller disposal
- No memory leaks from undisposed resources

### ‚úÖ User Feedback
- Loading indicators during initialization
- SnackBars for success/error messages
- Visual recording indicators
- Permission status clearly displayed

### ‚úÖ Code Organization
- Separate widgets for each concern
- Private methods prefixed with `_`
- Clear method names describing purpose
- Comments for complex logic

## Lessons Learned

### iOS Development
1. **Permissions are critical** - App won't work without proper Info.plist entries
2. **Test on real devices** - Camera features don't work in simulator
3. **Xcode signing required** - Must trust developer certificate on device
4. **Debug disconnect is normal** - App continues running independently

### Flutter Development
1. **Hot reload has limits** - Native changes require full rebuild
2. **Provider is powerful** - Makes state management straightforward
3. **Consumer widgets are key** - Automatically rebuild on state changes
4. **Debug UI is essential** - Show internal state to diagnose issues

### General Development
1. **Read error messages carefully** - Often contain exact solution
2. **Check model definitions** - Property names must match exactly
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't build everything before testing
4. **Document as you go** - Easier than reconstructing later

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Camera not available"
**Possible Causes:**
1. Permissions not granted
2. Info.plist missing permission descriptions
3. Camera initialization failed
4. Another app using camera

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check permission status in debugging UI
2. Verify Info.plist has all camera/microphone entries
3. Check iOS Settings ‚Üí App ‚Üí Permissions
4. Close other camera apps
5. Restart device if needed

### Issue: Build fails with property errors
**Solution:** Check actual model definition and use correct property names

### Issue: Flutter debugger disconnects
**Solution:** App still works, either reattach with `flutter attach` or test manually

### Issue: Changes not appearing
**Solution:** Use hot restart (R) instead of hot reload (r), or full rebuild for native changes
