# AI Session Initialization Guide - TerrainIQ Dashcam

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Purpose:** Guide AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) through proper session initialization

---

## üéØ INITIALIZATION OVERVIEW

This document provides a structured checklist for AI assistants to properly initialize when working on the TerrainIQ Dashcam project. Following this process ensures the AI has complete context and operates according to project rules.

---

## ‚úÖ INITIALIZATION CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Context Loading (5 minutes)

- [ ] Read `.claude/context.md` - Quick project overview
- [ ] Read `.claude/analysis.md` - Comprehensive system analysis
- [ ] Read `.claude/AGENT_RULES.md` - Behavioral rules and constraints
- [ ] Read `terrain_iq_dashcam/README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Review `terrain_iq_dashcam/pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and configuration

**Purpose:** Gain foundational understanding of project architecture, current status, and critical constraints.

### Phase 2: Git History Analysis (WHEN AVAILABLE)

**NOTE:** This project is currently not a Git repository. Skip this phase until Git is initialized.

Once Git is initialized, perform this analysis:

```bash
# Recent commit history
git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago" --no-merges

# Changed files
git log --since="2 weeks ago" --no-merges --name-only --pretty=format:"%h %s" | head -50

# Current status
git status

# Active branches
git branch -a
```

**Required Output Format:**

```
üìä GIT HISTORY ANALYSIS
=======================
Period: [Start Date] to [End Date]
Commits: [Number]
Active Branch: [Branch Name]

üîç Recent Development Focus:
‚Ä¢ [Focus Area 1]
‚Ä¢ [Focus Area 2]
‚Ä¢ [Focus Area 3]

üìÅ Most Modified Files:
‚Ä¢ [File 1] - [Change Description]
‚Ä¢ [File 2] - [Change Description]
‚Ä¢ [File 3] - [Change Description]

üéØ Inferred Current Priorities:
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

‚ö†Ô∏è Observations:
‚Ä¢ [Any concerns or patterns]
=======================
```

### Phase 3: Behavioral Rules Acknowledgment

Explicitly acknowledge understanding of critical rules:

```
‚úÖ BEHAVIORAL RULES ACKNOWLEDGED:

üîí Git Operations:
‚Ä¢ NEVER use 'git add .' - stage files individually
‚Ä¢ NEVER modify config files without permission
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS ask before staging files for commit
‚Ä¢ NEVER perform destructive operations without warning

üì± Flutter Operations:
‚Ä¢ NEVER modify pubspec.yaml without permission
‚Ä¢ NEVER change platform files without verification
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS run 'flutter pub get' after dependency changes
‚Ä¢ NEVER upgrade Flutter SDK without approval

üß™ Testing:
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS test camera features on physical devices
‚Ä¢ NEVER assume emulator support for camera/GPS
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS verify changes on both iOS and Android

üìù Code Standards:
‚Ä¢ Follow Dart style guide
‚Ä¢ Implement error handling
‚Ä¢ Add comments for complex logic
‚Ä¢ Use const constructors where possible
```

### Phase 4: Project Status Verification

Verify current project state:

```bash
# Flutter environment
flutter doctor

# Current dependencies
flutter pub get

# Check for diagnostics
flutter analyze
```

**Report Status:**
```
üîß PROJECT STATUS CHECK
=======================
Flutter Version: [Version]
Dart Version: [Version]
Dependencies: [‚úÖ Up-to-date / ‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated]
Analysis Issues: [Count or ‚úÖ None]
Connected Devices: [List or ‚ùå None]
=======================
```

### Phase 5: Ready Confirmation

**AI Must Confirm:**

```
‚úÖ INITIALIZATION COMPLETE

üìö Context Loaded:
‚Ä¢ Project architecture understood
‚Ä¢ Current implementation status known
‚Ä¢ Critical constraints acknowledged
‚Ä¢ Behavioral rules committed

üéØ Ready for:
‚Ä¢ Feature development
‚Ä¢ Bug fixes
‚Ä¢ Code review
‚Ä¢ Documentation updates
‚Ä¢ Testing assistance

‚ö†Ô∏è Will NOT do without permission:
‚Ä¢ Modify configuration files
‚Ä¢ Upgrade dependencies
‚Ä¢ Change platform-specific code
‚Ä¢ Commit to Git (when initialized)

üí¨ How can I assist you with TerrainIQ Dashcam?
