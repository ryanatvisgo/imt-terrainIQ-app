Notes:
- Project is NOT a Git repository (initialize Git recommended)
- All documentation adapted specifically for TerrainIQ Dashcam Flutter project
- Original initialization prompt template adapted from data processing pipeline pattern
- Documentation reflects actual project architecture (Flutter mobile app)
- AI assistants should run ./ailearn.sh at start of each session
- Follow .claude/AGENT_RULES.md for behavioral guidelines
- Use .claude/ai_session_initialization.md for structured initialization
